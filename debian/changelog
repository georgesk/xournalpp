xournalpp (1.0.18+repack-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Created two new branches: "upstream" and "debian" to comply with the
    preferred structure for git-buildpackage. The branches are based on the
    tag 1.0.18 from the upstream repository
    https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp
  * created the file debian/gbp.conf mainly to define the "debian" branch
    as debian-branch, and also to filter debian files upon import-orig
  * Rewriten file debian/copyright to comply with format
    https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
  * defined myself as Maintainer
  * upgraded Standards-Version: 4.1.3, debhelper and compat level : 11
  * removed git from build dependencies, as the build must be made without
    access to Internet.
  * Made the Description field shorter and adjusted the long description.
  * Improved the file debian/copyright : some authors were forgotten in
    previous versions of this file.
